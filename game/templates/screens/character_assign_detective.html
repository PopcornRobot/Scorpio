        <p>Today was supposed to be a good day. You made your world famous
        nachos for the party and spent the night dreaming about the compliments.</p>

        <p>Now you just found out that someone put two shots in your informant's head.
        What's worst, police on-site have reason to believe the perpetrator is
        hiding in this very party, ruining your night off.</p>
