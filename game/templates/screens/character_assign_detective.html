<h2>You are a detective</h2>

<p class=''><img src="{% static "img/detective.jpg" %}"  /></p>

<p>Today was supposed to be a good day. You are finally making some inroads on your case
  against organized crime and you're here celebrating your mentors retirement
  with all these good people from around the country.</p>

<p>Now you just heard over the police radio that someone put two shots in your informant's head.
  Police on the scene believe the perpetrator fled on foot and could be hiding at this very party.</p>

<p>But that's not what's bothering you. What bothers you is
there's no way anyone could have known he was your informant. Not this fast. There's got to be a leak in your department.</p>

<p>Find the murderer. Trust no one.</p>
