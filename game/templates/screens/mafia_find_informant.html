<h2>Informant detective #1: Smells like a rat</h2>

<p class=''><img src="{% static "img/rat.png" %}" style="width:400px"  /></p>

<p>Someone just called and told you there are missing items from the warehouse. Items that can expose you and your crew's identity.
  The whole thing feels like a setup. How could so many things go wrong at the same time?</p>

<p>
They believe that a traitor sent the items to the detectives at this party. You don't know which detective has it, but you know this:</p>

<p>INFORMANT DETECTIVE #1: {{ private_tip }}</p>


<p>The only way to stop the tip from being released is to kill the informant
  before they share the items with other detectives. This clue expires when the time runs out. </p>

<p>Warning: If you kill a detective that is not an informant, you will be exposed and the police will kill you.</p>
