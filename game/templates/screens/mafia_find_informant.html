        <p>At first you thought you were finished. The police had concrete
          evidence you were behind the Galway murders. So you hired someone to steal
          it for you, only to find out someone already stole it.
          <!-- Some meatheads must have thought they were just stealing a brick of weed. -->
        </p>

        <p>Your sources told you that the thieves were actually detectives looking to get high.
          Now that they know the evidence is actually important,
          they are trying to secretly find a trustworthy detective to return
          the evidence for them. </p>
        <p>This is your chance!</p>

        <div style="background-color:#000000; height:1px; width:100%;"></div>

        <p><em>GOAL:</em> The detectives below are trying to find a detective they trust
           <!-- pass the evidence
          to another detective. The good news is they don't want anyone to know
          (lest they get fired for stealing evidence) and they have to do it -->
          before time runs out.
          Sweet talk them into trusting you and get them to return the evidence back in your hands. </p>

        <p>Someone just called and told you there are missing items from the warehouse.
        Items that can expose you and your crew's identity.The whole thing feels like a setup.
        How could so many things go wrong at the same time?</p>

        <p>They believe that a traitor sent the items to the detectives
        at this party. You don't know which detective has it, but you know this:</p> -->

        <p>The only way to stop the tip from being released is to kill the informant
        before they share the items with other detectives. This clue expires when the time runs out.</p>

        <p>Warning: If you kill a detective that is not an
        informant, you will be exposed and the police will kill you.</p>
