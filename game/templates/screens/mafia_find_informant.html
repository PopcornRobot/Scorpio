        <p><em>You thought you were a goner.</em> </p>
        <p>The police had
          evidence you were behind the Galway murders. So you hired someone to steal
          the evidence for you, only to find out a detective already stole it.

          <!-- They were looking to get drunk. -->
          <!-- Some meatheads must have thought they were just stealing a brick of weed. -->
        </p>
        <p>Now the detectives want to return it.</p>
        <!-- <p>Now they know the evidence is important.
          They are looking for a trustworthy detective to return
          the evidence for them. </p>
        <p>This is your chance!</p> -->

        <p><em>GOAL:</em> The detectives below are looking for someone to trust
           <!-- pass the evidence
          to another detective. The good news is they don't want anyone to know
          (lest they get fired for stealing evidence) and they have to do it -->
          before time runs out.
          Pretend you are a detective and
          sweet talk them into giving the evidence back to you. </p>

        <p>Someone just called and told you there are missing items from the warehouse.
        Items that can expose you and your crew's identity.The whole thing feels like a setup.
        How could so many things go wrong at the same time?</p>

        <p>They believe that a traitor sent the items to the detectives
        at this party. You don't know which detective has it, but you know this:</p> -->

        <hr>
        <p>The only way to stop the tip from being released is to kill the informant
        before they share the items with other detectives. This clue expires when the time runs out.</p>

        <p>Warning: If you kill a detective that is not an
        informant, you will be exposed and the police will kill you.</p>
