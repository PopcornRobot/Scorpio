      <p>Small-time gangster, Jimmy Two-Lips, was found dead in his home.
      Witnesses heard two gun shots when they called the police.

      <p><strong>MISSING EVIDENCE FROM POLICE LOCKER!</strong></p>
      <p>Evidence linking the illegal alcohol establishment, the Blind Pig, with the
      Galway murders went missing last Sunday.
      <!-- This triggered an internal investigation into LAPD's detective unit. -->
      </p>

      <p>Sources say Internal Affairs is investigating the Police Department
      for possible links to the criminal organization <em>Scorpio</em>.</p>

      <p><strong>HOW THE GAME WORKS</strong></p>
      <p>Rumor has it that Scorpio has infiltrated tonight's party.
      Your goal is to gather notes and find them.</p>

      <p>To help detectives, tips about the criminal will be dropped throughout the game.
      These tips are real facts (e.g. â€œthis person skydived") that lead to real people.</p>

      <p>At the end of the game, the group will vote on the identity of the criminal. </p>

      <p><strong>THREE CARDINAL RULES</strong></p>

      <br>

      <ol>
        <li><em style="font-size:15px">No lies</em>. If someone asks you a question about your life,
        tell them the truth (within reason, of course). You can lie about who you think is
        the murderer.</li>

        <li><em style="font-size:15px">Check your phone every 10 minutes</em>. Your screen updates with new objectives and important information
        as the game progresses.</li>

        <li><em style="font-size:15px">Hide your screen!</em> Don't compromise your identity. Your screen reveals information
        about your identity.</li>
      </ol>
