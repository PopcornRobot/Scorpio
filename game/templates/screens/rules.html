      <p>Small-time gangster, Jimmy Two-Lips, was found dead in his home.
      Witnesses heard two gun shots when they called the police.

      <p>
      Responding officers found the victim in his underwear
      watching The Real Housewives of Pomona. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

      <!-- <p>Police officers believe this is the work of criminal organization <em>Scorpio</em>.
      The suspect fled on foot and hid amongst our group here.
      Police are relying on us to find them.
      The suspect is considered armed and dangerous.</p> -->

        <p class="blocktext garamond" style="font-size:22px;">MISSING EVIDENCE FROM POLICE LOCKER!</p>
        <p>Evidence linking the illegal alcohol establishment, the Blind Pig, with the
        Galway murders went missing last Sunday.
        <!-- This triggered an internal investigation into LAPD's detective unit. -->
        </p>

        <p>Sources say Internal Affairs is investigating the Police Department
           for possible links to the criminal organization <em>Scorpio</em>.</p>

        <p >Rumor has it that Scorpio has infiltrated tonight's party.
          Your goal is to gather notes and find them.

        </p>

        <p>To help detectives, tips about the criminal will be dropped throughout the game.
        These tips are real facts (e.g. â€œthis person skydived") that lead to real people.</p>

        <p>At the end of the game, the group will vote on the identity of the criminal. </p>

        <p class="blocktext" style="font-size:25px;">The Three Cardinal Rules</p>

        <p>1. <em style="font-size:15px">No lies</em>. If someone asks you a question about your life,
        tell them the truth (within reason, of course). You can lie about who you think is
        the murderer.</p>

        <p>2. <em style="font-size:15px">Check your phone every 10 minutes</em>. Your screen updates with new objectives and important information
        as the game progresses.</p>

        <p>3. <em style="font-size:15px">Hide your screen!</em> Don't compromise your identity. Your screen reveals information
        about your identity.</p>
