        <hr>
        <p>An hour ago, small-time gangster Jimmy Two-Lips was found dead in his home.
        Witnesses heard two gun shots when they called the police.
        Responding officers found the victim deceased in his underwear,
        watching The Real Housewives of Pomona.</p>

        <p>Police officers believe this is the work of criminal organization <em>Scorpio</em>.
        The suspect fled on foot and hid amongst our group here.
        Police are relying on us to find them.
        The suspect is considered armed and dangerous.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">HOW THE GAME WORKS</p>
        <p >The goal is to find the criminal hidden in the group.
        Gather notes and interrogate everyone.
        At the end of the game, everyone will vote on who is the murderer.</p>

        <p>To aid the search, tips are dropped throughout the game
        to reveal information about the murderer.
        Real facts like “this person skydived" that lead to real people.
        It’s your job to talk to each other and find out who the murderer is. </p>

        <ol style="padding-top:15px">
            <li><p><em style="font-size:15px">No lies</em>. If someone asks you a question about your life,
            tell them the truth (within reason, of course). You can lie about who you think is 
            the murderer.</p>

            <li><p><em style="font-size:15px">Check  phone every 10 minutes</em>. Your screen updates with new objectives and important information

            <li><p><em style="font-size:15px">Hide your screen!</em> Don't compromise your identity. Your screen reveals information
            about your identity.</p></li>
