      <!-- <p>The criminal mastermind, Scorpio, strikes again. This time murdering
        small-time gangster, Jimmy Two-Lips, in his home.
      Witnesses heard two gun shots when they called the police.

      <p>Responding officers found the victim in his underwear
      watching The Real Housewives of Pomona. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p> -->

      <!-- <p>Police officers believe this is the work of criminal organization <em>Scorpio</em>.
      The suspect fled on foot and hid amongst our group here.
      Police are relying on us to find them.

      <!-- <p><strong>MISSING EVIDENCE FROM POLICE LOCKER!</strong></p> -->
      <p>Evidence linking the mysterious criminal Scorpio to the
      Galway murders went missing last Sunday.
      <!-- This triggered an internal investigation into LAPD's detective unit. -->
      </p>

      <p>Internal Affairs is investigating  detectives
      for possible links to the nefarious criminal.</p>

      <p><strong>HOW THE GAME WORKS</strong></p>


      <p>Detectives have reason to believe Scorpio will infiltrate tonight's party.
        Your goal is to reveal the identity of the criminal Scorpio. </p>

      <p>Tips about Scorpio’s identity will be dropped throughout
        the game. Tips that are real facts (e.g. “this person skydived") that lead to real people.</p>

      <p>At the end of the game, the group will vote on who is Scorpio. </p>

         is the murderer.</p></li>
