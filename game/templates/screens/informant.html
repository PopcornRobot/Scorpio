        <p><em>It was all a big mistake...</em></p>

        <p>So I stole a brick of weed from the police locker. Big deal. </p>
        <p>Look, I know it sounds bad,
          but we handle so much evidence, most of it goes into the trash anyways.
          Plus, how was I
          supposed to know Sky High Farms was in cahoots with Scorpio.</p>

        <p>Now, I have to secretly return the evidence or it's my
          ass. </p>
