<p>You just received an anonymous package, but you can't make sense of it. Your gut feeling is
  it's an important clue to what the hell is going on here. You need the help of other detectives but you don't know who to trust.</p>

<p><em>Goal:</em> Create a list of detectives you trust before the timer ends. The bigger the list, the juicier
the tip that will drop.</p>

<p><em>Warning:</em> If the murderer is on your list, they may kill you. What makes things worse is they
are tracking the package, which means...</p>

<p>THEY ARE LOOKING FOR YOU.</p>

<p>If they find you before you submit your list, you and your tip are eliminated forever.</p>
  <p>The good news is they don't know who you are exactly yet.
  Donâ€™t disclose your role as the informant to anyone or they will find out.</p>

<p>TRUST NO ONE.</p>


<p>*** INSERT FORM CONTROLS TO SUBMIT A LIST OF MULIPLE PEOPLE ***</p>
<p>Your tip has been submitted. If you are right, a hint may be announced shortly. If not, it'll be your death. Good luck.</p>
