<h2>Your life is in danger</h2>

<p class=''><img src="{% static "img/danger.png" %}" style="width:400px"  /></p>
<p>You just received an anonymous package, but you can't make sense of it. Your gut feeling is
  it's important. You need the help of other detectives but which ones do you trust?</p>

<p><em>Goal:</em> Create a list of detectives you trust before the timer ends. The bigger the list, the juicier
the tip.</p>

<p><em>Warning:</em> If the murderer is on your list, they may kill you. What makes things worse is they
are tracking the package, which means...</p>

<p>THEY ARE LOOKING FOR YOU.</p>

<p>If they find you before you submit your list, you and your tip are gone, forever.</p>
  <p>The good news is they don't know who you are exactly yet.
  So donâ€™t disclose your role as the informant to anyone or they will find out.</p>

<p>TRUST NO ONE.</p>
